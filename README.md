This repository contains the source code of a simple iOS application for viewing Yu-Gi-Oh cards, created for educational and learning purposes.

The application offers the following features:
- Viewing basic card information, including name, type, attribute, level, ATK, and DEF.
- Card search by name.
- Support for English, Portuguese, and French languages.
- Dark mode support.

The application utilizes the YGOPRODeck API to access Yu-Gi-Oh card data. The main screen was developed programmatically, while the details screen was created using Storyboard.
